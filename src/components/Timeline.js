        <h3>EECE 230X: Empowering Minds Through Open Learning ü§ù</h3>
        <p>
          The EECE 230X initiative is a free, online course, generously open to
          all learners, serving as a beacon of knowledge supported by the
          esteemed Faculty of Engineering through an official certificate upon
          completion. Our commitment to accessibility and knowledge sharing is
          epitomized by the release of all course materials under a creative
          commons license and organized on a website our dedicated students
          created. The initiative witnessed an overwhelming response, with more
          than 2000 learners accessing the curated material. After 3 weeks of
          launching, we administered an entrance exam for all students who
          wanted to take it. The top-scoring students obtained access to a
          student-built auto-grading tool, teaching office hours, and the
          opportunity to earn a certificate upon passing the final exam. Almost
          50% of the students took the final exam and almost 50% of those who
          took it passed, which is a remarkable milestone.

        <p>
          Before the official establishment of AUB ACM, our journey began with
          the spark of a competitive programming community at AUB. In 2007, the
          visionary Mr. Nagi Nahas ignited this flame by conducting CP sessions,
          empowering students to step into the thrilling realm of programming
          competitions. Our students shined in the LCPC, ACPC, and ICPC, proudly
          ranking amongst the top 50-100 universities in the competition, a
          testament to the passion and dedication of our members. Behind every
          success story is our esteemed advisor, Professor Louay Bazzi. A
