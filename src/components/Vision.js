            We are not just enthusiasts; we are advocates on a mission. 
            ACM AUB passionately champions the cause of spreading the coding 
            culture across Lebanon. Our vision extends beyond the borders of 
            our university as we strive to cultivate a national coding 
            community that echoes with the rhythm of progress.
